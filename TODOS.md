need and do , next js routing refactoring 
replacing teacher terminologi with tutor everuhre in backend frontend  


profile (for crud prfile maintenance and updation)
        teacher
        student
        parent
student 
        dashboard
        homework
        attendance (shared  across student 'r', tutor 'rw' parent 'r')
        query (we should keep to have student-tutor discussion , and keep parent tutor query page separate fro student )

tutor
        dashboard

parent 
        payments
        query (for tutor parent discusion)

should we keep reports and attendance, shared under student so that parent and student can read reports, tutor can upload reports , just add a dummy data there in page meanitme  

auth routes are ok under correct filter grouped nicely 

take the links from the sidebaar you added and add dumy line in veyr page you create accoridn o the sidebar lnks you mentioend 

use of tabler icons instead of lucide react , we wil use tabler icons
