a code is generated on students side so that when tutors enters it the turos is verified to take a class, i need some form of plaknnig on this , maybe like a jwt encoding devcoding that is only verifiing hte class id  the tutot id astudients assigned to , somehing like htese paramters so that we have authenticated code entering and on tutor anad class verification, not like any sigle jwt secret can decode all any of the student class codes, the codes will be genrated everyday of on the class tiem student will trigger anad nanual process that generates and tokena adn teutor enters to verify the class prioces and begn with d o you get it? but before that we'd need clas sceduling mechanicsm , tutors can create class, once a tutor is assigned to students a recordign class eill be adsigned to between tutor and thte corspensing student  , this is how Attendance wil;l work , we hav e implemetn the ui of this now need logic , with attendance history 


don't modify the the majority breadcrumb logic but if you detect  an i from teh dsatbase in the name , fetch teh name from the db make the call asnd fetch teh name form the db and diplay in the breadcrumb , do this for only IDs when enoutering IDs in the breakdbroumb or the URL , thake those IDS snad and diaply by fetcvh ing the name form the respoective ID fromthe db 




 
don't modify the back end or anything don't build yet I'll see it myself
don't modify any rest of the code keep it as is don't modify any CSS just and tasks listed above users have to basic components on every page that is being rendered on front end

DUMMY DTA GENERATION FOR CLASSES atTENDANCE PER STUDENT , every model in schema

50 parents , their child added as STUDENT min : 1 and maximum 3 children  per parent
100 tutor profiles, their subjects the calleases per student , home work, reports, tutor parent query per parent , tuto student query per student  ,   
need and do , next js routing refactoring , queries visible on tutot dashboard as well 



profile (for crud prfile maintenance and updation)
        tutor
        student
        parent
student 
        dashboard
        homework
        attendance (shared  across student 'r', tutor 'rw' parent 'r')
        query (we should keep to have student-tutor discussion , and keep parent tutor query page separate fro student )

tutor
        dashboard

parent 
        payments
        query (for tutor parent discusion)

should we keep reports and attendance, shared under student so that parent and student can read reports, tutor can upload reports , just add a dummy data there in page meanitme  

auth routes are ok under correct filter grouped nicely 

take the links from the sidebaar you added and add dumy line in veyr page you create accoridn o the sidebar lnks you mentioend 

 
Tutor can upload  resources pdf/ add link to any video/ text/images. wil add direct video upoad later we wont fill our storage spcce so early
Tutor comem on home theres should also be a dedicated qr for a assignemed generated for a  student one-tie and then later per day a new qr ill be gnerated so that tutot can't hack the previous qr to mark attendance without coming home.  
qr generatio on demand, when it is clicked it will save server resouces, scan to mark attendace otherwise aut marked a tutor was absent. 

pwa notifications utilitity that call it wth a payload of text/image/etc,

## template
analyse the directory structure first note iwhat is already implemenet and what can be imporveed and then proceeed to next Provide a full, production-ready **development plan** for building the system described in the attached document. The plan must be exhaustive and actionable tona — not high-level fluff — and must include all of the following exactly:

1. **Scope & deliverables** — clear list of features, MVP, acceptance criteria.
2. **Execution strategy & sprintable action steps** — ordered tasks, estimated priority and testing checkpoints.
3. **Backend architecture** — folder layout, core services, workers/jobs, data models, (postgres prisma schemas), services api on frnend. and technology choices , a progressive web app frontendd in  nextjs  and backend in prisma postgres, redis caching, i am using  bun as a package manager, must be used bun. make it 
4. **API route layout** — complete REST route list (prefix, verbs, path, purpose, auth requirements) and sample request/response shapes for each endpoint.
with axios make as a service/api.js,

impose proper middlewares fro auth verified check, register as hostial patienr therrimifdlleware and ema
il verification with nodemailer
5. **Controller-level business logic** — per-route pseudocode outlining validation, authorization, transactions, side effects, error handling, and retry semantics 
6. **Auth/session design** — JWT access token + refresh token flow, rotation strategy, cookie vs header usage, CSRF handling, token revocation, role claims, and refresh endpoint semantics.
cors handling Frontend calls  
7. **Frontend architecture & routing** — nextjs (PWA) folder structure, page routes, component responsibilities, state management strategy (Redux reduc toolkit ), SW registration and push-subscription flow. shadcn talwind is already setu setup, some routes have already setup you may imporove backend. 
8. **Frontend–backend integration** — axios/fetch client patterns, interceptors for token refresh and retry,

12. **Security & validation** — input sanitation and proper field valiedation sing zod schemas,backedn api rate limiting, secrets management, HTTPS/TLS, CORS, and recommended libraries/config.
13. **Testing matrix** — dont build now no requirement, later job 
14. **Observability & monitoring** — dont build now no requirement, later job , but do a app and backend health checking routes.

Produce the plan as a developer-ready blueprint containing concrete commands, code snippets or pseudocode where appropriate, JSON shapes for schemas and API payloads, and explicit bun scripts and Docker commands to run and test locally. No conceptual overview only — include exact, repeatable steps and examples that an engineer can implement immediately.

routes associated wihth this, 
crud teacher profile
crud parent profile
crud student profile, maintained by parent. in india where tech literacy is not that high will giving ontrol everythin to parent will moreover increase the issue in usage of our app right? 
and rest of the routes requested in softwre requiemnets

Payment Gateway: Razorpay
- Real-time Communication: 
WebSockets  Socket.io  maybe with redis caching.
- Deployment Target:
i will be first deplying to vercel for testing later we can migrate to a vps, t the service is going to be run for  acouple of months on vercel i guess. is that causing a isue n hardcoded codebase change will that cause changes in codebase?
- Email Service:  
"nodemailer".  i will be testing a email service sfirst since i dont have a verfied domain, credit card or anytin to get a emal service plan.

- Typo Clarification: 
yes, Tutor/Parent middleware


-------

this is going to be pwa web app, no mobile app, we may skip the websockets part to skip the complexity of getting/setting/paying up a server and build the chat feature later after building the main mvp , skip email for now. 

we will generate a unique student id 
year+7_characters_uniuely_identifiable_string_across_the_database_uuid_is_too_long
and password, visible to parent dashboard, if student has mobile one or more mobile in their home they can eaily login into the devices and sart learninng, but another problem is that if home only has a parent device student got no device how wil we mitigate this problem. 
my oncern is  If a parent struggles with tech espiceial y with teh tech literacy rate in india , they will get overwhelmend by the procecss th and outr app will not work there in india.
