## 🌟 Philosophy

**Drona** is named after the legendary teacher from ancient Indian epics, embodying the spirit of mentorship and knowledge transfer. Our platform believes that:

- **Education should be accessible** - Breaking geographical and economic barriers between students and tutors
- **Quality matters** - Connecting learners with verified, skilled educators who are passionate about teaching
- **Accountability drives growth** - Both students and tutors benefit from transparent rating systems and progress tracking
- **Community empowers** - Building an ecosystem where learning is collaborative, not transactional

We're not just another tutoring marketplace; we're creating a comprehensive educational ecosystem with integrated session management, progress analytics, gamification through points systems, and automated scheduling.
